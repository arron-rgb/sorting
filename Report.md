# Objectives

1. 20 points - Make the program produce a SingleAscending.txt file that matches CorrectOutput/SingleAscending.txt.
2. 10 points - Make the program produce a SingleDescending.txt file that matches CorrectOutput/SingleDescending.txt.
3. 10 points - Make the program produce a SingleLastLetter.txt file that matches CorrectOutput/SingleLastLetter.txt.
4. 20 points - Write a brief report on what you found, what you did, and what other changes to the code you'd recommend.
5. 10 points - Make the program produce three MultiXXX.txt files that match the equivalent files in CorrectOutput; it
   must be multithreading.
6. 20 points - Improve performance as much as possible on both single-threaded and multithreading versions; speed is
   more important than memory usage.
7. 10 points - Improve safety and stability; fix memory leaks and handle unexpected input and edge cases.
